# Tic-Tac-Toe
instructions:
click on prefered square and try to get 3 in a row against yourself or a friend! As you click you will see whose turn it is based on an "X" or an "O" each user will be using. Enjoy playing!

Roadmap to Future:
I would implement a stopping of the game as of the winner winning in stead of continuously going back and forth until the page is full. I would also add a feature to add your own name as a player instead of being called player. This change would take place within the board level. I would use a text box with a onClick function that kept state of the names pushed in. I would then display this change with `${}` notation in order to make the name appear within the user <h1> i would have to update. For the buttons stopping as I or my opponent wins the game I would have to update my onClick function within the square buttons. I would need a conditional statement that specified that if any win takes place the buttons stop clicking. this could potentially be an unMounting of some kind but i would have to experiment a little more.
